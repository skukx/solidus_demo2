[Explain what your extension does.] 

## Installation

Add solidus_demo2 to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_demo2'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell

bundle exec rails g solidus_demo2:install
```

## Usage

[Explain how to use your extension once it's been installed.]

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_demo2/factories'
```

## Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```shell
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

### Releasing new versions

Your new extension version can be released using `gem-release` like this:

```shell
bundle exec gem bump -v VERSION --tag --push --remote upstream && gem release
```
